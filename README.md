   Hello Guys!!!
      
         This is SOWMYA. I did my undergraduation in electronics & communications from INDIA VIT.Presently doing my masters in information systems from  NJIT. I opted three courses for my first semseter- 
                                                  Web Systems Development
                                                  User Experience Design
                                                  System Analysis 
          Since my childhood I was always eager to learn more about advanced business analytics and information systems solutions, reading up on these topics  on my own time to become more knowledgeable. I would love to bring this passion in performing investigations to identify fraud and waste.
         My dream job is to become a Data Analyst and I believe It requires a willingness to take challenges, learn new technologies, ability to handle multiple tasks and meet project dead-lines in a fast paced environment.
